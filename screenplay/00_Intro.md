🎵 *[Background music begins: low, cinematic hum building slowly]*

🎙️ **Narrator (calm, dramatic tone):**

"In the heart of a star, atoms collide with unimaginable force...  
On Earth, we’ve learned to harness that same power — to boil water, to light cities, to split atoms and touch the very fabric of the universe."

**[Cut to fast clips: glowing reactor core, cooling towers, a scientist peering into a lab instrument]**

"But with that power came fear.  
Fear born from shadows of mushroom clouds...  
From names etched in memory — Chernobyl, Fukushima, Hiroshima."

**[Clips shift: archival footage of atomic bomb, sirens, disaster headlines]**

"Nuclear energy stands at a crossroads — a marvel of modern science, and a ghost of our most terrifying moments.  
To many, it's a promise of clean, limitless power...  
To others, it's a ticking clock we don’t quite understand."

**[Cut to public protests, headlines: “What Do We Do With the Waste?” “10,000 Years of Danger”]**

"And at the heart of the debate lies a silent legacy...  
A legacy we’ve buried, shielded, and sometimes tried to forget."

**[Music swells slightly. The screen darkens.]**

"What happens to the waste we leave behind?"

🎬 *[Cut to black screen. Silence. Then glowing text appears in center of screen.]*

# **Nuclear Energy: Waste Management”**

🎵 *[Music resumes: slow, contemplative, fading into next scene]*
